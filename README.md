Complete gatsby code for the udemy course "Gatsby JS with Wordpress, React, and GraphQL".

NOTE that this will not run without a running wordpress site running on localhost:8888/myawesomeportfolio.io. Also there needs to be at least 1 page, 1 menu, and at least 1 custom portfolio type in your wordpress site for this to work, as the gatsby code assumes that this data exists.
